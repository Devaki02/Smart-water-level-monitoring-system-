This project gives us a proper insight about water conservation through the

application of a water level monitoring system. Industries and homes where water

is used to a large extend can implement the given model to get the information

about the water level in real time . An ultrasonic sensor and a NodeMCU

Microcontroller are used to achieve the given results . Using the power of

internet, simplification can be further achieved for users as they will be able to

view the data from anywhere and thereby giving the power to monitor it from

anywhere and giving them chance to achieve the water loss from houses and

industries . The need for this control arises due to the fact that water loss is

happening at a critical rate and if not controlled the situation will worsen further.
